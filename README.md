# Atom Keyboard Shortcuts

This page lists keyboard shortcuts for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io) that I find valuable and use a lot. Feel free to fork the page and add your own favorites. Pull Requests welcome!

This list is by no means meant to be a complete listing of every available shortcut. It simply lists the shortcuts that I use on a regular basis. For a complete listing of all available shortcuts, consult the _Settings > Keybindings_ page in Atom.

Since I'm using a Mac, I have mainly listed the keyboard shortcuts macOS. Please feel free to add the Windows or Linux shortcuts.

Where the shortcut is provided by a package, I have added a link to the package.
